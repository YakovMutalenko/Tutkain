# Tutkain

An interactive Clojure development environment for Sublime Text.

## Status

**Currently unreleased**. You might not want to use this yet â€” I'm still
figuring things out.

**Alpha**. Expect breaking changes and a veritable cavalcade of bugs.

## Install

1. Clone this repo into your Sublime Text Packages directory.

   Tutkain is available on Package Control, but the version there is very old, and I don't advise using it at the moment.

More documentation coming up. Check back later.
