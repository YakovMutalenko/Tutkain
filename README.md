# Tutkain

An interactive Clojure development environment for Sublime Text.

## Status

**Currently unreleased**. You might not want to use this yet â€” I'm still
figuring things out.

**Alpha**. Expect breaking changes and a veritable cavalcade of bugs.

## Install

1. Clone this repo into your Sublime Text Packages directory.

   Tutkain is available on Package Control, but the version there is very old, and I don't advise using it at the moment.

2. Open a Clojure file (a file whose extension is `.clj`, `.cljc`, or `.cljs`).

3. Under **View** > **Syntax** > **Open all with current extension as...**, select "Clojure (Tutkain)". You must repeat this for each file extension.

More documentation coming up. Check back later.
